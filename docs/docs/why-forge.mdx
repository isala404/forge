# Why FORGE?

You've probably built apps with Next.js + Supabase, Firebase, or a custom Node.js stack. They work, but they all have the same problems. Let's talk about why FORGE might be a better choice for your next project.

## The Problem with Modern Stacks

### Next.js + Supabase

```
What you need:
├── Next.js (frontend + API routes)
├── Supabase (database + auth)
├── Vercel (hosting)
├── Upstash (Redis for queues)
├── Resend (emails)
└── Cloudflare (storage)

Total: 6 services to manage
Monthly cost: $50-200+
```

**Pain points:**
- API routes are scattered across `app/api/**`
- No type safety between client and server
- Background jobs need a separate service (Trigger.dev, Inngest)
- Real-time needs separate Supabase subscriptions
- Auth logic duplicated between client and server

### Firebase

```
What you deal with:
├── Firestore (NoSQL only)
├── Cloud Functions (cold starts)
├── Firebase Auth
├── Cloud Storage
└── Firebase Hosting

Vendor lock-in: 100%
```

**Pain points:**
- NoSQL means no joins, complex queries are hard
- Cold starts on Cloud Functions (seconds of latency)
- No local development experience
- Unpredictable billing
- Firebase rules are a separate language to learn

### Custom Node.js Stack

```
What you build:
├── Express/Fastify (API)
├── Prisma (ORM)
├── PostgreSQL (database)
├── Redis (caching, queues)
├── BullMQ (background jobs)
├── Socket.io (real-time)
└── Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring)

Time to production: 2-4 weeks
```

**Pain points:**
- Days of boilerplate before writing features
- Multiple services to deploy and monitor
- Each service can fail independently
- Type safety requires extra tooling (tRPC, etc.)

## The FORGE Solution

```
What FORGE gives you:
├── One binary (backend, jobs, crons, real-time)
├── PostgreSQL (the only dependency)
└── Svelte frontend (auto-generated types)

Services to manage: 1
Time to production: 1 day
```

### Everything in One Binary

FORGE compiles to a single Rust binary that includes:
- HTTP API gateway
- WebSocket for real-time
- Background job workers
- Cron scheduler
- Metrics, logs, and traces
- Admin dashboard

**No Redis. No message queues. No separate services.**

### Type Safety End-to-End

```rust
// Define your function in Rust
#[forge::query]
pub async fn get_user(ctx: &QueryContext, id: Uuid) -> Result<User> {
    // ...
}
```

```typescript
// TypeScript types are auto-generated
const user = await query('get_user', { id: 'uuid' });
// user is typed as User | null
```

No manual type definitions. No runtime type checking. If it compiles, it works.

### Real-Time Without the Hassle

```svelte
<script>
  // This just works. Updates automatically.
  const tasks = subscribe('list_tasks', {});
</script>

{#each $tasks.data ?? [] as task}
  <div>{task.title}</div>
{/each}
```

FORGE uses PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY under the hood. When data changes, subscribers update automatically. No WebSocket setup, no subscription management.

### Background Jobs Built-In

```rust
#[forge::job]
#[retry(max_attempts = 5, backoff = "exponential")]
pub async fn send_email(ctx: &JobContext, input: SendEmailInput) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.progress(50, "Sending email...");
    // Send the email
    ctx.progress(100, "Done!");
    Ok(())
}
```

```typescript
// Dispatch from frontend
const jobId = await dispatchJob('send_email', { to: 'user@example.com' });

// Track progress
const job = subscribeJob(jobId);
// $job.progress_percent, $job.progress_message
```

Jobs are persisted to PostgreSQL, survive server restarts, and have automatic retries with backoff.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | FORGE | Next.js + Supabase | Firebase |
|---------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Type safety | Full (Rust → TS) | Partial | None |
| Real-time | Built-in | Needs setup | Built-in |
| Background jobs | Built-in | Needs service | Cloud Functions |
| Cron jobs | Built-in | Needs service | Cloud Scheduler |
| Workflows (sagas) | Built-in | Needs service | ❌ |
| SQL database | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL | NoSQL only |
| Dashboard | Built-in | Supabase dashboard | Firebase console |
| Local development | Full | Partial | Limited |
| Vendor lock-in | None | Moderate | High |
| Cold starts | None | None | Yes |
| Self-hosting | Easy | Possible | ❌ |

## When to Use FORGE

**FORGE is great for:**
- SaaS applications
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Real-time collaborative apps
- Apps with complex business logic
- Apps that need background processing
- Teams that value type safety

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You need mobile-first (FORGE is web-focused)
- You want a fully managed solution (FORGE needs a server)
- Your team doesn't know Rust (learning curve)

## Performance

FORGE is fast. Really fast.

| Metric | FORGE | Node.js |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Startup time | ~100ms | ~2-5s |
| Memory usage | ~30MB | ~100-300MB |
| Request latency (p99) | ~5ms | ~20-50ms |
| Concurrent connections | 10,000+ | 1,000-5,000 |

The Rust advantage: no garbage collector, zero-cost abstractions, native async.

## Cost Comparison

For a typical SaaS app with 10,000 monthly active users:

| Service | FORGE | Next.js + Supabase |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Hosting | $20/mo VPS | $20/mo Vercel Pro |
| Database | Included | $25/mo Supabase |
| Background Jobs | Included | $30/mo Trigger.dev |
| Real-time | Included | Included |
| Monitoring | Included | $10/mo (basic) |
| **Total** | **$20/mo** | **$85/mo** |

FORGE runs on a single VPS. All services in one binary means lower costs.
